        <h1>FGN Savings Bond FAQs</h1>
        <button class="accordion">What is a bond?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A bond is a long-term financial obligation (debt) of an entity that 
              promises to pay a specified sum of money at specified future dates. Bonds are fixed income securities.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">What are Federal Government Bonds?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Federal Government bonds are long-term debt instruments of the Federal Government of Nigeria with tenors of up to 
              10 years. FGN bonds are issued by the DMO on behalf of the governments through authorized primary market dealers.
               If you are an investor looking at investing money for a period longer than 1 year, or tend to have deposits or placements 
              that have been running for more than a year, FGN bond
               investment will likely suit your investment appetite</p>

               <p>FGN bonds provide a desirable savings or investment vehicle for many reasons. 
                   They tend to be safer than stocks because if you hold bonds until the maturity date, 
                   you don’t risk the principal. However if you need to sell your bond before its maturity date,
                    you may lose or gain a bit depending on the ruling price at the point of exit. Without exiting 
                    prematurely, FGN bonds provide a regular, 
                   steady source of income (typically, interest payments are received every 6 months).</p>
